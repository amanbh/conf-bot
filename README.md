A chat bot for hosting a conference chat on XMPP (gtalk/jabber etc.)

Uses [Smack API](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/)

Developed at a time when Google Talk was popular, but groups feature was missing. Used for:
 - a permanent chat group at my dorm. 
 - as a Anagrams game server for Tech-fest.
 - to push notifications from Student Placement Office announcements during placement week.
